    "- SQL stands for Structured Query Language. SQL is a query language not a database system.\n",
    "- It is a standard language that was designed to query and manage the data in RDBMS.\n",
    "- SQL is used to perform operations on the records stored in the database, such as updating records, inserting records, deleting records, creating and modifying database tables, views, etc.\n",
    "\n",

    "### DBMS\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you want to perform the queries of SQL language on the stored data in the database, you are required to install any database management system in your system.\n",

    "- The basic use of SQL for SQL users is to insert, update and delete the data from the relational database.\n",
    "- SQL allows SQL users to retrieve the data from the RDBMS.\n",
    "- It also helps them to describe the structured data.\n",
    "- It allows SQL users to create, drop and manipulate the database and its tables.\n",
    "- It also helps in creating the view, stored procedure and functions in the relational database.\n",
    "- It allows you to define the data and modify that stored data in the relational database.\n",
    "- It also allows SQL users to set the permissions or constraints on table columns, views and stored procedures."

    "2. The schema of SQL database is predefined, fixed and static.\n",
    "3. SQL databases display data inform of tables so it is known as table-based database.\n",
    "4. SQL databases use a powerful language \"Structured Query Language\" to define and manipulate the data.\n",

    "3. NoSQL databases display data as collection of key-value pair, documents, graph database or wide-column stores.\n",
    "4. In NoSQL databases, collection of documents are used to query the data. It is called Un-structured query language. It varies from database to database.\n",
    "5. NoSQL databases are not so good for complex queries but best suited for hierarchical data storage.\n",
